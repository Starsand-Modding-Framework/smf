## 🎯 Vision

SMF aims to provide a powerful, flexible and respectful modding foundation for **Starsand Island**, inspired by frameworks like **Fabric** and **Forge** from the Minecraft ecosystem.

- 🛠️ Add new features without modifying the base game
- 🔌 Modular system for mods and libraries
- 🎮 No cheating or unfair advantages – creativity only
- 💻 Works across Steam, Epic & standalone versions
- 🧱 Fully open-source and community-approved

---

## 📦 Planned Features

- ✅ `mod.yml` metadata format with dependency management
- ✅ Clear separation between **mods** and **libraries**
- ✅ Dynamic event bus (inspired by [Aether Events](https://github.com/aether-framework/aether-events))
- ✅ Safe access to in-game systems via public interfaces (e.g. `IPlayer`, `IWorld`)
- ✅ Optional UI library: `StarUI` for in-game menus
- ✅ Plug & play `/mods` folder – no core modifications
